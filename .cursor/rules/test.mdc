# General Rules

- Write the tests inside a testing suite of the Testify library 
- Tests always use mocks generated with the Mockery library. They will be in the mocks/ subdirectory, in the same path of the test. If they are not present, search them in the project following the import of the interfaces, If you can't find them, notify it
- Use the Arrange - Act - Assert pattern
- If you need to import mocks from differente packages, always use aliases
- Verify all mock expectations in the TearDownTest() method of the suite
- Place the tests in the same package of the original file
